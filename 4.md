# Classes and Objects
* Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

## Naive Recursion is Naive
* Recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number 
```
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

## Fixtures
* When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".
* You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world, and they take a variety of different forms.
* In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. For example, say you have a file that returns a list of lines from a file, in which each line is reversed:
```

def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
```
* If you're going to test this function, you'll need to pass it a file-like object. In my last article, I showed how you could use a StringIO object for such a thing, and that remains the case. But rather than defining global variables in your test file, you can create a fixture that'll provide your test with the appropriate object at the right time.
```
@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```
