#TDD with Python

* It's important to take baby steps when completing unit tests in python. We want to make sure we break down the bigger problems of our projects to small steps that we can implement in tests to stop bugs before they star and give us faster results.

```
def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():

    detector = GenderDetector()

    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)

    assert expected_gender == ‘female’
```

    Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
    Act: here you will execute the code being tested,
    Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

## The Cycle 
* Write a unit test and make it fail.
* Write the feature and make the test pass!
* Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one.

## Takeaways 
* The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first.
* Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace.
* Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to practice!
