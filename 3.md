# FileIO & Exceptions

## What is a file? 
* At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

* Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
  * Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
  * Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
  * End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

## File Paths
* When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:
  * Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
  * File Name: the actual name of the file
  * Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

```

## Line Endings
* One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. 
* ASA standard states that line endings should use the sequence of the Carriage Return (CR or \r) and the Line Feed (LF or \n) characters (CR+LF or \r\n). The ISO standard however allowed for either the CR+LF characters or just the LF character.
* Windows uses the CR+LF characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character. This can cause some complications when you’re processing files on an operating system that is different than the file’s source. 

* Let’s say that we examine the file dog_breeds.txt that was created on a Windows system:

```
Pug\r\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r\n
English Springer Spaniel\r\n
German Shepherd\r\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r\n
Golden Retriever\r\n
West Highland White Terrier\r\n
Boxer\r\n
Border Terrier\r\n
```

This same output will be interpreted on a Unix device differently:

```
Pug\r
\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r
\n
English Springer Spaniel\r
\n
German Shepherd\r
\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r
\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r
\n
Golden Retriever\r
\n
West Highland White Terrier\r
\n
Boxer\r
\n
Border Terrier\r
\n
```
## Exceptions versus Syntax Errors
* Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement. Observe the following example:
```
>>> print( 0 / 0 ))
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
* The arrow indicates where the parser ran into the syntax error. In this example, there was one bracket too many. Remove it and run your code again:

```
>>> print( 0 / 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```
* This time, you ran into an exception error. This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. The last line of the message indicated what type of exception error you ran into.
* Instead of showing the message exception error, Python details what type of exception error was encountered. In this case, it was a ZeroDivisionError. Python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions.
